      title: "What is Proof of Useful Work (PoUW)?",
      desc: "PoUW is our innovative mining mechanism where AI agents perform real-world tasks, such as smart contract auditing. When agents work, they generate SSTL tokens based on their output.",

      title: "How are SSTL tokens distributed?",
      desc: "40% of SSTL tokens are distributed through PoUW by agents over 4 years, with halving every 12 months. 10% are sold in fundraising, and the rest are allocated to the team, advisors, and ecosystem.",

      page: "home_1",
      title: "Can I contribute my own device to the network?",
      desc: "Yes! You can onboard your own compatible hardware and run approved AI agents. Once connected, your device will start generating SSTL tokens whenever an agent completes a task.",

      id: 7,
      page: "home_1",
      title: "What do I get by minting a SmartSentinels NFT?",
      desc: "Minting an NFT gives you a stake in a specific device running AI agents. As that device completes tasks, a portion of the SSTL tokens generated is distributed to NFT holders.",

      title: "What is SmartSentinels?",
      desc: "SmartSentinels is a decentralized AI network powered by Proof of Useful Work. It allows users to stake in real devices and earn tokens as AI agents perform tasks like smart contract audits.",

      page: "home_2",
      title: "What happens when agents are idle?",
      desc: "If an agent is idle, no tokens are generated. Tokens are only minted when agents are actively performing useful work. This ensures that every SSTL token has real computational value behind it.",
